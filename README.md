A Final Year Project
# Scope of Project

Malicious applications targeting account information have increased dramatically over the last years. The number of online applications is growing strong. The ease of use of the Internet and the growing user base make a perfect target for criminals. Attacking thousands of users is achievable with only one click.

The methods used by these criminals vary immensely, but they have one thing in common: they are getting more and more sophisticated. With these increasing threats, governments are issuing stronger legislations and companies are realizing that their current systems cannot thwart current attacks anymore. To counter these threats, new authentication systems have to be adopted. Not only the criminal side has made advances in the last years. The security industry developed new mechanisms and protection systems to thwart even the most sophisticated attacks.

The goal of this project is to provide a secure system to authenticate a person on the internet by implementing a secure API that can be used as a replacement/substitute for the current authentication options i.e. username password based authentication. The aim is to use image based authentication and other secure authentications features that allow the user to securely browse and use the internet.
